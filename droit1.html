<p class="textedroit">All rights reserved. No part of this website/content may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including electronic or mechanical, without the prior written permission of the author, except as permitted by law.</p>

<p><b>What does the "all rights reserved" notice mean?</b> <br><br>

The "all rights reserved" notice doesn't provide the creator with anything beyond what the law already allows: namely, the exclusive right to exploit their work as they see fit. The notice doesn't prohibit anything beyond what the law prohibits: namely, the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted content. <br><br>

So, what's the purpose of this notice? <br><br>

"All rights reserved" is the translation of the phrase "all rights reserved," an American expression necessitated by U.S. copyright regulations prior to their accession to the Berne Convention (1989). <br><br>

The expression means that the copyright holder reserves all rights to exploit the content. <br><br>

It also means that the right granted to the viewer, listener, or reader to use the medium on which the work appears is limited to personal use. In France, the expression "cercle de famille" is used, which prohibits, for example, reproduction or public distribution, whether for profit or free. <br><br>

In other words, by affixing the "all rights reserved" notice, the copyright holder warns you that they reserve all rights to exploit their work. In doing so, they're simply restating the content of the law. Thus, even if a photo, video, or drawing does not contain the "all rights reserved" notice, it doesn't mean that the content is free of rights. <br><br>

On the contrary, unless it has fallen into the public domain (work created before 1933), no work is by definition free of rights. <br><br>

Moreover, in France, there is a moral right attached to the work that never expires. <br><br>

This moral right essentially consists of the author's right to claim paternity of the work and to preserve its integrity (even if the author has transferred the exploitation rights to the work, also known as economic rights). <br><br>

Please note, respecting the right to paternity (by mentioning the author's name and not altering the work) does not authorize the use of a work (a video, a drawing, a photo, audio content) without the author's permission.</b></p>
